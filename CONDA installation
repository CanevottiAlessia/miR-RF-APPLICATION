   ```

#### Step 2: Open Terminal

   Access your terminal or command line interface.

2. **Navigate to the Downloaded File:**
   Use the `cd` command to move to the directory where the downloaded installer script is located.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/directory
   ```

#### Step 3: Run the Installer

1. **Run the Installer Script:**
   Use the following command to execute the downloaded installer script:

   ```bash
   bash Anaconda3-2021.05-Linux-x86_64.sh
   ```

2. **Follow the Installer Prompts:**
   The installer will display installation instructions on the terminal. Follow the prompts and agree to the terms and conditions.
   

#### Step 4: Set Up the Environment

1. **Agree to License Agreement:**
   Agree to the license terms by typing `yes`.

2. **Choose Installation Location:**
   Select the directory to install Anaconda or press Enter to accept the default location.

3. **Conda Initialization:**
   Allow the installer to initialize Conda by appending the installation location to your system PATH.

4. **Complete Installation:**
   After the installation is complete, you may need to restart the terminal or use the `source` command to update your settings:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

### Additional Notes:

- **Checking Installation:**
  To verify that Conda has been installed, you can type `conda list` in the terminal. This command should display a list of installed packages if Conda is set up 
  correctly.
